# ipeds-peers
Use peer list data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for various analyses.  The IPEDS data are collected and disseminated by the National Center for Education Statistic (NCES) of the United States Department of Education.

These peer lists are used to produce each postsecondary institution's Data Feedback Report (DFR).  Many institutions have customized these lists.  However, if an institution has never customized this list it will have a default peer group that was assigned by NCES when the initial DFR was generated for that institution.
